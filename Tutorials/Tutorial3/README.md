##Tutorial 3: Creating a Basic Map

In this tutorial, you will be making a basic map of Aleppo, Syria through the use of *Open Source* GIS software, [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). You will download *Country level* Geographic Open Data from [Humanitarian Response](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/) and [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/). Next, you will bring in  *Neighborhood Level Data* of Aleppo from the [CSR](http://www.c4sr.columbia.edu/) Data Repository, along with *Street Level Data* from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org). You will then design a *Map* with Legend and Scale and Export it as a PDF. Optionally, you can stylize it, in [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). 

### Tools:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following tools:
* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
* [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)

### Datasets:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following datasets:
* Aleppo.zip, Download [here](/Tutorials/Tutorial3/Data/Aleppo.zip)
* Aleppo_Dem.zip, Download [here](/Tutorials/Tutorial3/Data/AleppoDem.zip)
* Neighborhood.zip, Download [here](/Tutorials/Tutorial3/Data/Neighborhood.zip)
  
### Datasets Overview:
This section provides detailed explanation of each data source. You can skip this section, if you would like to continue with the tutorial. However, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these sources, as they will asssist you in your research.

##### Country Level Data:
*Country Level Data* used to be provided by [Humanitarian Response](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/applications/data); a respository maintained by UN OCHA to support humanitarian operations globally. The **Common Operational Datasets (CODs)** are critical datasets that are used to support the work of humanitarian actors across multiple sectors. They are considered a de facto standard for the humanitarian community and should represent the best-available datasets for each theme. The **Fundamental Operational Datasets (FODs)** are datasets that are relevent to a humanitarian operation, but are more specific to a particular sector or otherwise do not fit into one of the seven COD themes.</br>

Note: In order to note the availability of Country Level Data, it is recommended to get an overview from the Humanitarian Response website. You can follow the links for each individual download. Alternatively, you can shift to HDX website. 

**Humanitarian Data Exchange**, [HDX](https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org) is a good place for open data as it presents a *consolidated repository* of data collected through multiple sources. The goal of the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is to make humanitarian data easy to find and use for analysis. If you are interested in exploring datasets from multiple Humanitarian Agencies, it is recommended that you register yourself on the HDX website. You can select regions and organisations of interest and explore the vast collection of datasets.
