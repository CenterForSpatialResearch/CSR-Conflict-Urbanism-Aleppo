##Tutorial 6: Designing a Simple Cluster Map

In this tutorial, you will be using, UNOSAT's Damage Analysis, *open data*, from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange] website, to design an Interactive Cluster Map, using Web tools, Mapbox and the Open Source Library Leaflet. You will use the .shp file provided by UNOSAT of damage locations marked and edit and export it as a .js file. You will then use *open source* library leaflet an it's built in *cluster* function to design the interactive map. Lastly, you will edit the css, to change the look of the clusters. 

### Tools:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following tools:
* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
* [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)


### Datasets:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following datasets:
* UNOSAT.zip, Download [here](link to repository)
* Cluster1.zip, Download [here](link to repository)

  
### Datasets Overview:
This section provides detailed explanation of the data source. You can skip this section, if you would like to continue with the tutorial. However, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these sources, as they will asssist you in your research.

##### Data set 1:
Copy from Tutorial 3: Bring data from HDX

Likewise, UNITAR/UNOSAT maintains a good repository on their site and frequently updates the data. THe data is all made available on HDX but you can always check UNITARs site to see if thye have an update. 

### Tutorial Title: Designing a Simple Cluster Map

##### Steps:
  * 01. QGIS: Explore UNOSAT dataset
  * 02. WEB: Export dataset .js format
  * 03. WEB: Design UNOSAT Cluster Map
  * 04. WEB: Change Clusters Appearance 
  * 05. WEB: Embed Map in your Case Study 

##### 01. QGIS: Explore UNOSAT dataset

unosate  / look and save

##### 02. WEB: Export dataset .js format

set as .js

##### 03. WEB: Design UNOSAT Cluster Map

##### 04. WEB: Change Clusters Appearance

##### 05. WEB: Embed Map in your Case Study 

Using the code, provide in [tutorial2](), you can embed any interactive website, in your case study. Test `width` and `height` ratios, to see what works best for you. Note: You will need to upload your site in order to embed it. You could test it using a locally saved .html file. If you save it in the same folder as the casestudy, just  use *filename.html*. Furthermore, it can be tricky to have this working within your case study. 


```html
<iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src= "filename.html" name="iframe_x"></iframe> 
<p><a href="filename.html" target="iframe_x">Interactive Site</a></p>
```
