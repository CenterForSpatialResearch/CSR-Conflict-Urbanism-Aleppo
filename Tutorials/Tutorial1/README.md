##Tutorial 1: Mapping Aleppo

In this tutorial, you will be using [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/36.2022/37.1619) to map your selected region of Aleppo. CSR worked with [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org/) to set a project on OSM's tasking manager, for mapping the urban form and damage in Aleppo. The project, restricted to invite-only allows users to map Aleppo and mark damage by comparing current High Resolution Satellite Imagery.
