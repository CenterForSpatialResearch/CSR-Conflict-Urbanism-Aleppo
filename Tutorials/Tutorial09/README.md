##Tutorial 6: Designing a Categorized Cluster Map

In this tutorial, you will be using, the Cultural Heritage Sites, *open data*, from the [Humanitarian Information Unit] website, to design an Interactive *Catergorized* Cluster Map, using Web tools, Mapbox and the Open Source Library Leaflet. You will use the .shp file provided by HIU of identified cultural heritage sites and edit and export it as a JSON file, using QGIS. You will then use *open source* library leaflet an its built in *cluster* function to design the interactive map based on categories. Lastly, you will edit the css, to change the look of the clusters. 

### Tools:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following tools:
* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
* [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)


### Datasets:
For this tutorial, we will be using the following datasets:
* CulturalSites.zip, Download [here](link to repository)
* Cluster2.zip, Download [here](link to repository)

  
### Datasets Overview:
This section provides detailed explanation of the data source. You can skip this section, if you would like to continue with the tutorial. However, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these sources, as they will asssist you in your research.

##### Data set 1:
Cultural Sites Data: Bring

### Tutorial Title: Designing a Simple Cluster Map

##### Steps:
  * 01. QGIS: Explore / Edit HIU dataset
  * 02. WEB: Export dataset as JSON file
  * 03. WEB: Design Categorized Cluster Map
  * 04. WEB: Change Clusters Appearance 
  * 05. WEB: Embed Map in your Case Study 

##### 01. QGIS: Explore / Edit HIU dataset

edit / check

##### 02. WEB: Export dataset as JSON file

export as json

##### 03. WEB: Design Categorized Cluster Map

add categories details / colors / code

##### 04. WEB: Change Clusters Appearance 

css.

##### 05. WEB: Embed Map in your Case Study 

Using the code, provide in [tutorial2](), you can embed any interactive website, in your case study. Test `width` and `height` ratios, to see what works best for you. Note: You will need to upload your site in order to embed it. You could test it using a locally saved .html file. If you save it in the same folder as the casestudy, just  use *filename.html*. Furthermore, it can be tricky to have this working within your case study. 

```html
<iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src= "filename.html" name="iframe_x"></iframe> 
<p><a href="filename.html" target="iframe_x">Interactive Site</a></p>
```
